c stands for client

```
c1-test.js
```

assumes the server is running

all of the other tests have the client and server together...

to start the server run

```
npm start
```

from the top...

create a file called f1.js and it should look like this:

```
{"key": "Your Auth Token String Goes Here"}
```

NOTE: This file **f1.js** is in .gitignore so you do NOT accidentally
check it in to github.
